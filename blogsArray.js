        p1:"When you look good, you feel good! One of the most noticeable aspects of you is your hair. The key to keeping your curls strong and healthy is to use the right products. With the right protective measures, your afro can have all the thickness and bounce it deserves.",
        p2:"I can see myself wearing every single palette this summer although my favorites are Medium Coral and Medium Rose Gold. I like that Light Coral is lighter but still shows up my skin. If you have ultra fair skin tone I think Light Coral will be the best option for you. Deep Rose Gold is so beautiful but pulls very dark on my skin. Even with a light hand it’s too dark but that means this will most likely show up on deeper skin tones.",
        p3:"We’ve been collecting the Chanel bronzers every year for as long as I can remember. This year they brought 5 shades and I love how soft and naturally glowy they look on the skin. Each compact has 3 shades you can use individually or swirl together. The compacts are oversized like the ones from 2022. Each color has enough product you can definitely dip your brush into each shade without overlapping colors if you prefer.",

        p1:"Caring for your curly hair can be quite challenging, especially if you aren’t familiar with what works with your hair and what doesn’t. To make the process easier, hair care experts have classified hair into distinct categories and sub-categories based on texture and curl patterns. Curly hair falls into the Type 3 category, which is further divided into 3A, 3B and 3C subcategories. Understanding which category and sub-category your hair falls into is the first and most crucial step giving your hair the TLC it needs. Here’s what you need to know about caring for Type 3 hair.",
        p2:"Shampooing Once A Week  African hair is naturally dry and lacks oil. Gently shampoo your curls once a week for proper cleansing. However, overdoing it can lead to frizz and breakage. Use a sulphate-free shampoo to prevent dryness.    Leave-In Moisturizer   Moisture is your best friend! Use a leave-in moisturiser on days when you don’t wash or condition your hair. TCB Naturals Leave-In Treatment contains a unique blend of shea butter and coconut oil, which deeply moisturizes and nourishes your hair. Regular use can rejuvenate your hair making it silky, smooth and voluminous. Sealing the moisturized hair with oil further helps you trap in the moisture, which in turn promotes hair growth.",
        p3:"Comb It The Right Way  Having curly hair means continuously dealing with knots and tangles. Gently run your fingers through your hair before combing them, this will help eliminate big knots. Make sure you use a wide-toothed comb and avoid tugging too hard. Avoid brushing or combing them from the roots, it causes breakage. Start brushing from the middle and gently make your way up.   Natural Afro hair requires special care, give Let’s Help You Maintain Your Natural Hair a read, so your locks stay healthy and gorgeous.",

        p1:"Many ingredients combined can make a heavenly skin recipe – others just don’t belong together. Mixing certain active ingredients can compromise the skin barrier and lead you down an uncomfortable path of inflammation, irritation and dehydration. But how do you know what does and doesn’t make the perfect skincare partner? Here we give you the lowdown on the art of skincare match-making...",
        p2:"Retinol is a hero ingredient that boosts skin cell turnover, boosts collagen, supports sloughing of dead skin cells, and combats free radical activity to prevent cellular damage. To get nerdie, retinol is a derivative of vitamin A and natural precursor to retinoic acid. Once it’s absorbed into the skin, retinol is converted into retinoic acid, which is the active form of vitamin A, so the skin can reap the benefits of it.",
        p3:"Retinol and vitamin C are two powerhouse active ingredients that have amazing skin-boosting properties but can lead to irritation when layered together. As the use of retinol requires acclimatisation and can be irritating to some, it shouldn’t be used at the same time as vitamin C. This doesn’t mean that the you can’t include both in your regime though! Our Chemist Gabriela recommends using vitamin C underneath your broad-spectrum SPF in the morning as SPF shields the skin from UV rays, while vitamin C combats free radical damage caused by UV exposure. Then, use retinol at night to support the skin’s natural processes of cellular repair and proliferation which occur while you are sleeping.",
